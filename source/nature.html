Aga Khan Palace

Occupying an area of about 19 acre, this palatial mansion was once used as a prison by the British for Mahatma Gandhi, Kasturba Gandhi and Mahadeo 
Desai, as well as Miraben, Pyarelal Nair, Sarojini Naidu and Dr Sushila Nayar.

Bhimashankar Temple

Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Bhimashankar Temple is sixth among the 12 jyotirlingas (devotional shrines of Lord Shiva) in India. Rajasthani and Gujarati 
influences can be clearly seen in the Nagara (or Indo-Aryan) architectural style of the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) and shikahara (tower) of 
the temple.
